# GoFynd Ecommerce Interview Challenge Solution.
## TIMING : ONE HOUR

Deployed at https://testappone353.herokuapp.com/imdb/

Challenge:

Here is a task we would like you to do -

Create a RESTful API to search for movies(something similar to IMDB). For this we would like you to use:
1. SQLlite to store data,
2. Any Python Framework for implementing the API endpoints.

There should also be a decent implementation to search for movies.
For your convenience I have attached some data that you can use to populate your database.
Try and deploy this on Heroku.


The timeline for this is 1 hours. Make your design decisions wisely, you will be asked questions on the implementation at the end of the task.
