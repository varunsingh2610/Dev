FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT
Create a RESTful API for movies (something similar to IMDB).
For this we would like you to use:

1. MySql or SQLlite to store data

2. Any Python Framework for implementing the APIs.
    There need to be 2 levels of access:-
    Admin = who can add, remove or edit movies.
    Users = who can just view the movies.

3. There should also be a decent implementation to search for movies.
4. Document your code well so that we can test the API with ease.
5. For your convenience I have attached some data that you can use to populate your database.
6. Try and deploy this on Heroku. Ensure that you parse the JSON file and ingest it into the application deployed on Heroku.
7. Feel free to add features!
